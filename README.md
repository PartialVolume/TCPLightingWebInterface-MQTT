# TCPLightingWebInterface-MQTT - Can be used with MQTT & IFTTT
This is a fork of the fabulous TCPLightingWebInterface (https://github.com/bren1818/TCPLightingWebInterface) created by bren1818.

This project aims to remove cloud dependance by leveraging MQTT. While leaving the IFTTT focused API available. 

This is acheived through an additional python script (generated as need by a PHP script) and  a small API change
